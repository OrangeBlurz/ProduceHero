# Produce Hero

## Overview

This project was used as an interview project for ChefHero.  It contains a list of pre-populated cities, each containing a seriese of restauarnts with unique orders.  Users can see all the restaurants and launch maps to thier location.  Order item quantities can be changed and can be deleted.

The time requirements of the project did not indicate adding items, cities or restaurants so those features have not been added.

## Architecture

It was built using Androidx MVVM architecture with a series of Activities as views.

## Improvments

The biggest improvement that I should have made was to change the Activities to Fragments
